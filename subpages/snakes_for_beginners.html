                Corn snakes have a healthy balance of large and small when it comes to sizing. They are not 'teeny' snakes, but they are a non-intimidating size for beginners who would like a snake big enough to hold in both hands. Some species are larger than others, but overall, their thin body will make them not seem as long.

                Corns snakes may be the best species for people who are new to snake keeping and are recommended often. They also come in many different colors; some natural, others are selectively-bred 'morphs'. Corn snakes offer a lot of benefits for people who want an easy-going, reasonably-sized, and colorful snake with simple care. Just be sure to get a readily available captive-bred animal.</p>

                <figcaption><b>Antaresia childreni</b></figcaption><figcaption><i>Source: Pixabay</i></figcaption>
            </figure>

            Size: 30-36 inches (2.5 feet is the most common)
            Availability: Common from snake dealers.
            Temperament: Calm as adults. A little more feisty as babies.
            Feeding Response: Moderate. Adults should feed on frozen/thawed mice.
            <p class="Magazine_text">
                Looking for a 'mini python'? This species is certainly for you. The Children's python (named after a person, not their suitability for children) is easy to keep and breed, and they only reach an extremely reasonable length of no more than 40 inches (3 feet and 4 inches) which is very small for a snake. These miniature animals can be kept in a 15 gallon tank, but even two snakes will be fine in a 20 gallon. It the wild, this species feeds mostly on frogs and lizards, so naturally they can be finicky when younger, which is the case with most snakes. Nearly all available Children's pythons will be acclimated to eating frozen/thawed mice.


                There are a few other species of python that are closely related to the Children's python and are very similar in appearance. The Anthill python is the smallest python in the world, reaching only 24-30 inches and length. There is also the spotted python and the large-blotched python. These snakes have similar care requirements.</p>

            </figure>
            Size: Males 12-18 inches and females 24-40 inches
            Availability: Relatively uncommon. They will likely only be found in online classifieds and breeder websites.
            Temperament: Very easy to handle. Has no front teeth!
            Feeding Response: Specialist feeder. Slow feeding response.
            <p class="Magazine_text">
                While these unusual snakes are not readily available like the others on this list, they are surprisingly easy to care for and are the only species that can be considered to be a ‘vegetarian’. African egg-eating snakes, as their name suggests, feed exclusively on eggs and require no whole animal prey. The only catch is that you will need a reliable source of extra small quail or finch eggs that are preferably fertilized. These eggs can be found in Asian food markets, online, and sometimes bird breeders will provide them, however some of these are not fertilized. The website Reptilinks.com sells small eggs that are fertilized, although some have fully developed chicks that cannot be fed. When using frozen eggs, defrost in warm water and lightly shake until you detect ‘sloshing’ in the inside, then feed immediately. If you can locate their food, these small snakes make lovely pets that have no front teeth but rarely bite anyway.</p>

            Feeding Response: Excellent
            <p class="Magazine_text">
                Not only are these snakes unique in their appearance, with their stout body and upturned snout, but they also possess interesting behaviors. These animals have impressive bluffing behavior when they feel threatened; they hiss, flatten their body, and may even play dead as a last ditch effort. Captive-bred snakes however, rarely feel the need to put on these defensive displays with their easy-going nature. They also rarely bite, and hognose snakes that are defensive will even strike at their opponent with a closed mouth. These snakes may also secrete a smelly musk in defense. These snakes are simple to care for and can be kept in a small, inexpensive enclosure (20 gallon tank or plastic bin), however they do require supplemental lighting.</p>

                These tiny boas are fabulous for people who want a snake that stays small both in girth and length. They are colorful and can be housed in a tank as small as 10 gallons or a similarly-sized plastic tub comfortably. The cage doesn’t even need to include much décor, since these snakes prefer to burrow and excessive items can get in their way. Just be sure to provide the recommended substrates. Most Kenyan sand boas have a reasonable disposition although some individuals can be flighty, however they do not prefer to bite in defense. Bites can occur however if the snake mistakes your hand for food, but this can be avoided with proper handling.</p>
