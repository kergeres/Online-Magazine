                Ball Python Cage: What Type of Tank Is Best and What Size Should It Be?
                The first thing you’ll need to provide your ball python with is a suitable enclosure. There are several different types of enclosure from which you can choose, and each presents different benefits and drawbacks.</p>

            <h3 class="headline_c">The most commonly used enclosure types include:</h3>

            <div class="terrarium_content">
                <div class="terrariums">

                    <span class="headline_d">Glass aquaria</span>
                    <p class="small_magazine_text">
                        Glass aquaria are readily available and typically quite affordable. They also offer unparalleled visibility, which will make it easy to see your pet. However, aquaria are quite fragile, and they can be difficult to move around. Additionally, glass aquariums do not retain heat very well.<br><br></p>

                    <span class="headline_d">Commercially manufactured cages</span>
                    <p class="small_magazine_text">
                        Commercially manufactured reptile cages are usually the best option for ball python keepers. Commercial cages are typically made from lightweight plastic, feature front-opening doors and are designed to accommodate heating devices. They aren’t as widely available as aquaria, so you may need to purchase one online.<br><br></p>

                    <span class="headline_d">Plastic storage boxes</span>
                    <p class="small_magazine_text">
                        Plastic storage boxes can make suitable ball python habitats, and they are both affordable and lightweight. They’re also easy to find at big-box retailers and hardware stores. However, they don’t provide a good view of your pet, as they’re typically translucent (as opposed to transparent). You’ll also need to modify them by drilling air holes and making them escape-proof.<br><br></p>

                    <span class="headline_d">Custom-built enclosures</span>
                    <p class="small_magazine_text">
                        Custom-built enclosures are a great option for keepers who have the skill and desire to build them. However, they are usually best designed by keepers with a bit of experience, rather than beginners.<br><br></p>

            <p class="Magazine_text">
                <br>No matter what type of enclosure you select, you must ensure that it provides your pet with enough room. Habitat size is a hotly debated topic among keepers, but generally speaking, adult ball pythons will require a habitat that provides between 3 and 6 square feet of space. Young ball pythons require only a fraction of this space.

                Ball pythons don’t climb very frequently, so enclosure height isn’t terribly important. Habitats that provide 12 to 18 inches of height are sufficient.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h3 class="headline_c">Hide Boxes</h3>
            <p class="Magazine_text">
                Once you’ve chosen a suitable vivarium, there are a few things you’ll need to place inside the enclosure.

                Don’t be surprised if your snake spends most of its days hidden away; this is the sign of a healthy and happy ball python. So, to make it feel at home, provide your snake with at least 2 hide boxes.

                Place one on the warmer side and one on the cooler side of its enclosure. If you place a third hide box in the middle of the vivarium, try raising the humidity in this box. This will give your ball python plenty of options.</p>

            <h3 class="headline_c">Water Bowl</h3>
            <p class="Magazine_text">
                Make sure the water bowl is heavy enough that it won’t get knocked over. It doesn’t need to be very large, but a decent sized bowl can help to encourage humidity in your enclosure. This Exo Terra Water Dish is a great size for ball pythons. Be sure to change the water every 3-4 days.</p>

            <h3 class="headline_c">Additional Landscaping</h3>
            <p class="Magazine_text">
                You could add depth and texture to your vivarium with low-level branches, a re-purposed plant pot, or live plants. However, bear in mind that these things cannot easily be sanitized.

                Ball pythons are a terrestrial (ground-dwelling) species, so they do not need lots of additional things to climb on. Nonetheless, they do explore their surroundings at nighttime. Some snakes may appreciate a small, low-level branch in their enclosure.</p>

            <h3 class="headline_c">Temperature</h3>
            <p class="Magazine_text">
                Ball pythons require more heat than many other snakes. If you don’t provide them with enough heat, they’ll be unable to digest their food and could become very ill. As with all snakes, it’s important to provide a thermal gradient (a range of temperatures your snake can access according to their needs).

                You should aim for an ambient temperature of around 82°F (28°C) and not let this dip below 75°F (24°C). The hotter part of the enclosure should be between 88-92°F (31-33°C), and no warmer than 96°F (36°C). You can achieve this by placing a reptile heat mat or under-tank heater (UTH) underneath one-third of your enclosure. This must be controlled by a thermostat. The cooler side should be between 75-80°F (24-27°C).

                It’s a good idea to purchase two thermometers so that you can measure the temperature at each side of your enclosure. The most cost-effective and accurate thermostat for heat pads and heat lamps is a pulse proportional thermostat (PPT) such as iPower Digital Heat Mat Thermostat. Whereas regular thermostats turn the device on/off when a particular temperature has been reached, PPT’s send small pulses of activity to maintain the correct temperature.<br><br></p>
