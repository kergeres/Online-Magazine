                Ball Python Cage: What Type of Tank Is Best and What Size Should It Be?
                The first thing you’ll need to provide your ball python with is a suitable enclosure. There are several different types of enclosure from which you can choose, and each presents different benefits and drawbacks.</p>

            <h3 class="headline_c">The most commonly used enclosure types include:</h3>

                    <p class="small_magazine_text">
                        Glass aquaria are widely available and typically quite affordable. They also offer the most visibility, which will make it easy to see your pet. However, the aquariums are fragile, and it is difficult to move them around. Also, glass aquariums don’t keep the heat very well.<br><br></p>

                    <p class="small_magazine_text">
                        Commercially manufactured reptile cages are the best option for your snake. They are usually made from lightweight plastic, have front-opening doors and are designed to accommodate heating devices. The cages are not used as frequently, as glass aquariums, so you may need to purchase them online.<br><br></p>

                    <p class="small_magazine_text">
                       Plastic storage boxes are affordable, lightweight, and are a suitable option for pet snakes. They are easy to find in almost any department store in varying sizes. On the down side, the boxes are translucent as opposed to transparent, so you won’t have a wiev of your pet. Also, you will have to modify the boxes, drilling air holes into them.<br><br></p>

                        Custom-built enclosures are a great option for those who have the skill and desire to build them. However, they are usually best designed with experience, beginner keepers don’t always know what’s best for their snake.<br><br></p>

                <br>No matter what type of enclosure you choose, the most important aspect is your pet having enough room. Size of habitat is debated frequently among keepers, and snakes vary in sizes, and agility. It is very important that you are well informed about the type of snake you are getting. If you’re not sure what your pet needs, we offer consultation.<br><br>

                Once you’ve chosen a suitable vivarium, there are a few things you’ll need to place inside the enclosure.

                Don’t be surprised if your snake spends most of its days hidden away; this is the sign of a healthy and happy ball python. So, to make it feel at home, provide your snake with at least 2 hide boxes.

                You could add depth and texture to your vivarium with low-level branches, a re-purposed plant pot, or live plants. However, bear in mind that these things cannot easily be sanitized.

                Ball pythons are a terrestrial (ground-dwelling) species, so they do not need lots of additional things to climb on. Nonetheless, they do explore their surroundings at nighttime. Some snakes may appreciate a small, low-level branch in their enclosure.</p>




            <h3 class="headline_c">Temperature</h3>
            <p class="middle_magazine_text">
                Ball pythons require more heat than many other snakes. If you don’t provide them with enough heat, they’ll be unable to digest their food and could become very ill. As with all snakes, it’s important to provide a thermal gradient (a range of temperatures your snake can access according to their needs).<br><br></p>

            <p class="middle_magazine_text">
                You should aim for an ambient temperature of around 82°F (28°C) and not let this dip below 75°F (24°C). The hotter part of the enclosure should be between 88-92°F (31-33°C), and no warmer than 96°F (36°C). You can achieve this by placing a reptile heat mat or under-tank heater (UTH) underneath one-third of your enclosure. This must be controlled by a thermostat. The cooler side should be between 75-80°F (24-27°C).

                It’s a good idea to purchase two thermometers so that you can measure the temperature at each side of your enclosure. The most cost-effective and accurate thermostat for heat pads and heat lamps is a pulse proportional thermostat (PPT) such as iPower Digital Heat Mat Thermostat. Whereas regular thermostats turn the device on/off when a particular temperature has been reached, PPT’s send small pulses of activity to maintain the correct temperature.<br><br></p>
