            <p class="Magazine_text">For many people, their pet is a major part of the family. They can bring all types of joy to you and your family; however, they are also a big responsibility that some pet owners don’t realise. Not only do you have to continuously care for your new pet around the clock, it is imperative that you choose a pet that suits your lifestyle to make it easier for you and a smoother transition for your new four-legged friend.<br><br>
                Owning a pet is a massive responsibility that some people don’t realise. It is extremely important that you weigh up all the costs, your lifestyle and other factors when deciding whether or not you should get a new pet. Many pets are abandoned at shelters as their owners cannot or will not look after them. If you make the decision of getting a new furry friend, remember that it is for their entire life.<br><br>https://www.petplan.com.au/blog/dog/responsibilities-of-pet-ownership/

            <h2 class="headline_b top_margin" id="corn_snake">Snakes for beginners</h2>

            <h3 class="headline_c">1. Corn Snakes</h3>
            Size: Around 4 feet. Some can reach 5 feet.
            Availability: Extremely common.
            Temperament: Very docile. Very young snakes can be flighty.
            Feeding Response: Older snakes (not small babies) usually have an excellent feeding response.
            <p class="Magazine_text">
                Corn snakes have a healthy balance of large and small when it comes to sizing. They are not 'teeny' snakes, but they are a non-intimidating size for beginners who would like a snake big enough to hold in both hands. Some species are larger than others, but overall, their thin body will make them not seem as long.

                Corns snakes may be the best species for people who are new to snake keeping and are recommended often. They also come in many different colors; some natural, others are selectively-bred 'morphs'. Corn snakes offer a lot of benefits for people who want an easy-going, reasonably-sized, and colorful snake with simple care. Just be sure to get a readily available captive-bred animal.</p>

            <h3 class="headline_c">2. Children’s Python</h3>

            Size: 30-36 inches (2.5 feet is the most common)
            Availability: Common from snake dealers.
            Temperament: Calm as adults. A little more feisty as babies.
            Feeding Response: Moderate. Adults should feed on frozen/thawed mice.
            <p class="Magazine_text">
                Looking for a 'mini python'? This species is certainly for you. The Children's python (named after a person, not their suitability for children) is easy to keep and breed, and they only reach an extremely reasonable length of no more than 40 inches (3 feet and 4 inches) which is very small for a snake. These miniature animals can be kept in a 15 gallon tank, but even two snakes will be fine in a 20 gallon. It the wild, this species feeds mostly on frogs and lizards, so naturally they can be finicky when younger, which is the case with most snakes. Nearly all available Children's pythons will be acclimated to eating frozen/thawed mice.


                There are a few other species of python that are closely related to the Children's python and are very similar in appearance. The Anthill python is the smallest python in the world, reaching only 24-30 inches and length. There is also the spotted python and the large-blotched python. These snakes have similar care requirements.</p>

            <h3 class="headline_c">3. African Egg-Eating Snake</h3>
            Size: Males 12-18 inches and females 24-40 inches
            Availability: Relatively uncommon. They will likely only be found in online classifieds and breeder websites.
            Temperament: Very easy to handle. Has no front teeth!
            Feeding Response: Specialist feeder. Slow feeding response.
            <p class="Magazine_text">
                While these unusual snakes are not readily available like the others on this list, they are surprisingly easy to care for and are the only species that can be considered to be a ‘vegetarian’. African egg-eating snakes, as their name suggests, feed exclusively on eggs and require no whole animal prey. The only catch is that you will need a reliable source of extra small quail or finch eggs that are preferably fertilized. These eggs can be found in Asian food markets, online, and sometimes bird breeders will provide them, however some of these are not fertilized. The website Reptilinks.com sells small eggs that are fertilized, although some have fully developed chicks that cannot be fed. When using frozen eggs, defrost in warm water and lightly shake until you detect ‘sloshing’ in the inside, then feed immediately. If you can locate their food, these small snakes make lovely pets that have no front teeth but rarely bite anyway.</p>

            <h3 class="headline_c">4. Western Hognose</h3>
            Size: 14 inches to 3 feet (females are larger)
            Availability: Common
            Temperament: Docile. Engages in harmless bluffing.
            Feeding Response: Excellent
            <p class="Magazine_text">
                Not only are these snakes unique in their appearance, with their stout body and upturned snout, but they also possess interesting behaviors. These animals have impressive bluffing behavior when they feel threatened; they hiss, flatten their body, and may even play dead as a last ditch effort. Captive-bred snakes however, rarely feel the need to put on these defensive displays with their easy-going nature. They also rarely bite, and hognose snakes that are defensive will even strike at their opponent with a closed mouth. These snakes may also secrete a smelly musk in defense. These snakes are simple to care for and can be kept in a small, inexpensive enclosure (20 gallon tank or plastic bin), however they do require supplemental lighting.</p>

            <h3 class="headline_c">5. Kenyan Sand Boa</h3>
            Size: 20 inches to 2 feet long (females are larger)
            Availability: Common
            Temperament: Passive personality, some individuals can be flighty.
            Feeding Response: Baby snakes often need to start with live feeding, purchase older
            <p class="Magazine_text">
                snakes that are confirmed to be feeding on frozen/thawed.
                These tiny boas are fabulous for people who want a snake that stays small both in girth and length. They are colorful and can be housed in a tank as small as 10 gallons or a similarly-sized plastic tub comfortably. The cage doesn’t even need to include much décor, since these snakes prefer to burrow and excessive items can get in their way. Just be sure to provide the recommended substrates. Most Kenyan sand boas have a reasonable disposition although some individuals can be flighty, however they do not prefer to bite in defense. Bites can occur however if the snake mistakes your hand for food, but this can be avoided with proper handling.</p>

            Ball Python Cage: What Type of Tank Is Best and What Size Should It Be?
    The first thing you’ll need to provide your ball python with is a suitable enclosure. There are several different types of enclosure from which you can choose, and each presents different benefits and drawbacks.</p>

            <h3 class="headline_c">The most commonly used enclosure types include:</h3>

            <div class="terrarium_content" >
            <div class="terrariums" >

            <span class="headline_d">Glass aquaria</span>
                <p class="small_magazine_text">
                    Glass aquaria are readily available and typically quite affordable. They also offer unparalleled visibility, which will make it easy to see your pet. However, aquaria are quite fragile, and they can be difficult to move around. Additionally, glass aquariums do not retain heat very well.<br><br></p>

            <span class="headline_d">Commercially manufactured cages</span>
                <p class="small_magazine_text">
                    Commercially manufactured reptile cages are usually the best option for ball python keepers. Commercial cages are typically made from lightweight plastic, feature front-opening doors and are designed to accommodate heating devices. They aren’t as widely available as aquaria, so you may need to purchase one online.<br><br></p>

            <span class="headline_d">Plastic storage boxes</span>
                <p class="small_magazine_text">
                    Plastic storage boxes can make suitable ball python habitats, and they are both affordable and lightweight. They’re also easy to find at big-box retailers and hardware stores. However, they don’t provide a good view of your pet, as they’re typically translucent (as opposed to transparent). You’ll also need to modify them by drilling air holes and making them escape-proof.<br><br></p>

            <span class="headline_d">Custom-built enclosures</span>
                <p class="small_magazine_text">
                    Custom-built enclosures are a great option for keepers who have the skill and desire to build them. However, they are usually best designed by keepers with a bit of experience, rather than beginners.<br><br></p>



                </div>
                </div>

            <p class="Magazine_text">
                <br>No matter what type of enclosure you select, you must ensure that it provides your pet with enough room. Habitat size is a hotly debated topic among keepers, but generally speaking, adult ball pythons will require a habitat that provides between 3 and 6 square feet of space. Young ball pythons require only a fraction of this space.

            Ball pythons don’t climb very frequently, so enclosure height isn’t terribly important. Habitats that provide 12 to 18 inches of height are sufficient.<br><br>
                 </p>

            <h3 class="headline_c">Hide Boxes</h3>
            <p class="Magazine_text">
                Once you’ve chosen a suitable vivarium, there are a few things you’ll need to place inside the enclosure.

                Don’t be surprised if your snake spends most of its days hidden away; this is the sign of a healthy and happy ball python. So, to make it feel at home, provide your snake with at least 2 hide boxes.

                Place one on the warmer side and one on the cooler side of its enclosure. If you place a third hide box in the middle of the vivarium, try raising the humidity in this box. This will give your ball python plenty of options.</p>

            <h3 class="headline_c">Water Bowl</h3>
            <p class="Magazine_text">
                Make sure the water bowl is heavy enough that it won’t get knocked over. It doesn’t need to be very large, but a decent sized bowl can help to encourage humidity in your enclosure. This Exo Terra Water Dish is a great size for ball pythons. Be sure to change the water every 3-4 days.</p>

            <h3 class="headline_c">Additional Landscaping</h3>
            <p class="Magazine_text">
                You could add depth and texture to your vivarium with low-level branches, a re-purposed plant pot, or live plants. However, bear in mind that these things cannot easily be sanitized.

                Ball pythons are a terrestrial (ground-dwelling) species, so they do not need lots of additional things to climb on. Nonetheless, they do explore their surroundings at nighttime. Some snakes may appreciate a small, low-level branch in their enclosure.</p>

            <br><br>https://www.snakesforpets.com/ball-python-tank-setup-ideas/


            <h3 class="headline_c">Temperature</h3>
            <p class="Magazine_text">
                Ball pythons require more heat than many other snakes. If you don’t provide them with enough heat, they’ll be unable to digest their food and could become very ill. As with all snakes, it’s important to provide a thermal gradient (a range of temperatures your snake can access according to their needs).

                You should aim for an ambient temperature of around 82°F (28°C) and not let this dip below 75°F (24°C). The hotter part of the enclosure should be between 88-92°F (31-33°C), and no warmer than 96°F (36°C). You can achieve this by placing a reptile heat mat or under-tank heater (UTH) underneath one-third of your enclosure. This must be controlled by a thermostat. The cooler side should be between 75-80°F (24-27°C).

                It’s a good idea to purchase two thermometers so that you can measure the temperature at each side of your enclosure. The most cost-effective and accurate thermostat for heat pads and heat lamps is a pulse proportional thermostat (PPT) such as iPower Digital Heat Mat Thermostat. Whereas regular thermostats turn the device on/off when a particular temperature has been reached, PPT’s send small pulses of activity to maintain the correct temperature.</p>
